    <h2><i>Introduction</i></h2>
    <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Vy which pronouned as Vee. I am a student who is currently living and studying in the US.
       I was born in Vietnam and came to America 3 years ago to pursue my degree in Computer Science. After getting my associate 
       degree in Science from Moraine Valley community college, I am at Lewis University as a transfer student. Talking a little 
       bit about my family, I grow up in a Vietnamese family of five. Most of my family members are now living in my home country 
       except for me and one of my sister.</p>
    <h2><i>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</i></h2>
    <p>As an SC student, I always want to gain more knowledge and skills that will benefit my learning career and also my future
        job. In this class, I am looking to learn about software development which potentially provides me the foundation for long-term 
        learning in this field. I am excited to know about engineering principles and processes to develop computer programs. I particularly 
        want to understand how programs are developed using different programming languages and tools. </p>
    <h2><i>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</i></h2>
    <p>I love to watch movies and read manga when I have free time. I also listen to music very often as it helps me release stress from
        my studies. I like a wide range of music. My biggest hobby would be traveling. My student life is quite busy, so I don't usually 
        have a lot of time to spend on traveling. But if I have a chance, I would love to explore more beautiful places in the US and then 
        in the world.</p>
    <h2><i>Fun Fact about me</i></h2>
    <p> I didn't start studying computer science until I came to the US to study three years ago. I have studied international business 
        administration for almost two years in Vietnam and plan to continue my studies in the US. However, I was attracted to computer 
        science after having the opportunity to learn about it and decided to focus on it. There is nothing better than we can learn 
        and do what we love. </p>
